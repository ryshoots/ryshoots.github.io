title: "About Me"

<br> Hi! I’m Ry, a photographer who somehow turned “I like taking pictures of random crap” into a whole hobby… and now a website (if I can maintain it). I started shooting because... well, I have no clue, I just started one day, and at this point my camera is basically an extra limb I carry everywhere. Except the bathroom, that's gross.

This site is where I post my favorite shots, my accidental masterpieces, and the occasional “why did I even take this?” photo. I mostly love nature photography, but I also wander into other styles whenever I convince myself I’m “branching out.”

When I’m not taking photos, you can usually find me flying drones, attempting to code, reading fantasy books, drowning in schoolwork, procrastinating editing, or telling myself that buying another gizmo or gadget ***will absolutely improve my life.***

Thanks for stopping by! If you want to say hi, send me a message — I respond faster than my camera battery dies (not really saying much, my batteries last scary long). :)
